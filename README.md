# 🚀 Agent Hub  

**Agent Hub** is a powerful, centralized platform that allows users to **discover, manage, and interact with AI agents**.  
Designed for both **developers** and **end-users**, Agent Hub provides a seamless way to organize AI agents, run them dynamically, and integrate them into workflows—all from a single, intuitive interface.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- **Centralized AI Agent Management**  
  Host all your AI agents in one place. Import agents built in **n8n**, custom code, or JSON-based configurations. Easily search, manage, and execute them.  

- **Dynamic Agent Integration**  
  Connect agents to live workflows via **webhooks** or **APIs**. Configure system prompts, input/output parameters, and endpoints dynamically.  

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Browse, filter, and select agents with ease. Each agent has a dedicated page with description, usage instructions, and examples.  

- **JSON-Based Import/Export**  
  Import and export agent configurations as JSON for portability, migration, or programmatic creation.  

- **Supabase Backend**  
  Securely stores agent configurations, user data, and metadata. Includes **real-time sync**, **authentication**, and robust **JSON handling**.  

- **Bolt.dev Frontend**  
  Built with **Bolt.dev**, delivering a responsive and interactive interface. Chat-like interactions and instant results.  

- **AI-Driven Interactions**  
  Agents can leverage models like **OpenAI GPT**, **Gemini**, or any LLM backend for intelligent automation.  

- **Extensible & Scalable**  
  Add new agents anytime via APIs, webhooks, or local imports—no downtime required.  

- **Secure & Private**  
  Authentication via Supabase ensures authorized usage. Sensitive keys are never exposed on the frontend.  

- **Analytics & Monitoring (Planned)**  
  Future versions will include dashboards for usage tracking, logs, and optimization.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the Repo  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agent_hub.git
cd agent_hub
```

### 2. Setup Supabase  
- Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com).  
- Copy your **API keys** and **project URL**.  
- Add them to `.env` file:  

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

### 3. Run Frontend (Bolt.dev)  
If using [Bolt.dev](https://bolt.new), open the project in Bolt and link to the Supabase backend.  

### 4. Import Agents  
- Add agent configurations via JSON.  
- Or create agents via the UI.

## 📄 Example Agent JSON  

```json
{
  "id": "support_bot",
  "name": "Customer Support Bot",
  "description": "Handles customer queries using GPT-4",
  "endpoint": "/api/support",
  "config": {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful support assistant.",
    "inputs": ["query"],
    "outputs": ["response"]
  }
}
```
